*[zm system](http://51feel.info) — Simple linux system for work
==================================================

Overview
-----------------------------------------
zm software is developed based on the debian system, similar to livecd, compresses the entire system into a squashfs file, and realizes read and write with unionfs. It has several main functions:
1. Install the system with one command. The installation medium can be a hard disk, USB flash drive, CD, etc. The entire system has only 4 files: kernel, initrd, root.sfs, home.sfs.
2. Support generating differential files, and the differential files are also compressed into squashfs files.
3. The top-level differential is stored in memory by default, so the startup and common software operations are very fast.
4. Comes with a backup system, which backs up the working directory as a squashfs file, and the backup file also supports differential.
5. Directly generate the disk image required by the virtual machine.
The stable kernel of Debian supports aufs. Unstable no longer supports aufs by default. The overlayfs bug of /proc/self has not been resolved. It is not recommended to use overlay to back up the system in unstable.


Partition
-----------------------------------------
The system automatically recognizes and starts based on the disk volume label.
Partition software can use gparted or gnome-disks.
Support lvm partition and recommend to use it.
The file system is recommended to be ext4.
The volume label of the system partition is sfsroot, and it is recommended to be 20G.
The optional work partition volume label is work, which is used to mount /work, the working disk partition, the larger the better.
The optional swap partition volume label is swap, and it is recommended to be 4G.
The optional backup partition volume label is backup, which is used to store backup projects, and it is recommended to be 200G.

Zeroman: 读取zm文件，查看所有函数就知道了

GitHub Copilot: Here's some code in Bash that reads the `zm` file and prints out all the function names:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read the zm file
zm_file="zm"
zm_content=$(cat "$zm_file")

# Use grep to find all lines that start with "function"
# Then use awk to print the second field (the function name)
function_names=$(echo "$zm_content" | grep "^function" | awk '{print $2}')

# Print out the function names
echo "Functions in $zm_file:"
echo "$function_names"
```

This script reads the `zm` file, finds all lines that start with the word "function", and prints out the second field (which is the function name). The output will be a list of all the function names in the `zm` file.

# zm system

`zm` is a simple Linux system for work, developed based on the Debian system. It compresses the entire system into a squashfs file and realizes read and write with unionfs. It has several main functions:

- Install the system with one command. The installation medium can be a hard disk, USB flash drive, CD, etc. The entire system has only 4 files: kernel, initrd, root.sfs, home.sfs.
- Support generating differential files, and the differential files are also compressed into squashfs files.
- The top-level differential is stored in memory by default, so the startup and common software operations are very fast.
- Comes with a backup system, which backs up the working directory as a squashfs file, and the backup file also supports differential.
- Directly generate the disk image required by the virtual machine.

## Parameters

The following parameters are used in the `zm` system:

- `sfsroot`: The volume label of the system partition. It is recommended to be 20G.
- `work`: The optional work partition volume label. It is used to mount `/work`, the working disk partition. The larger the better.
- `swap`: The optional swap partition volume label. It is recommended to be 4G.
- `backup`: The optional backup partition volume label. It is used to store backup projects. It is recommended to be 200G.

## Commands

The following commands are available in the `zm` system:

- `zm`: The main command for installing and managing the system.
- `zm install`: Installs the system with one command. The installation medium can be a hard disk, USB flash drive, CD, etc.
- `zm update`: Updates the system to the latest version.
- `zm backup`: Backs up the working directory as a squashfs file. The backup file also supports differential.
- `zm restore`: Restores the system from a backup file.
- `zm diff`: Generates differential files, which are also compressed into squashfs files.
- `zm version`: Shows the version of the `zm` system.
- `zm osname`: Shows the name of the operating system.

## Usage

To install the `zm` system, follow these steps:

1. Download the `zm` file.
2. Create a partition with the volume label `sfsroot` and format it as `ext4`.
3. Create an optional work partition with the volume label `work` and format it as `ext4`.
4. Create an optional swap partition with the volume label `swap`.
5. Create an optional backup partition with the volume label `backup`.
6. Run the command `zm install` and follow the prompts.

To update the `zm` system, run the command `zm update`.

To back up the working directory, run the command `zm backup`.

To restore the system from a backup file, run the command `zm restore`.

To generate differential files, run the command `zm diff`.

To show the version of the `zm` system, run the command `zm version`.

To show the name of the operating system, run the command `zm osname`.

## Conclusion

The `zm` system is a simple and efficient Linux system for work, with easy installation and management. It is recommended for users who need a lightweight and fast system for their work.
